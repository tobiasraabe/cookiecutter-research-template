This repository lays out the structure for a reproducible research project based on the
Waf framework.

It is derived from https://github.com/hmgaudecker/econ-project-templates and the authors
of this project deserve all the credit for the implementation of Waf as a framework for
reproducible research. My contribution is to add several helpers around the project
which are common in software engineering and should help researchers to write better
code, therefore more comprehensible and reproducible research.
