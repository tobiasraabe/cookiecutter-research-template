This repository lays out the structure for a reproducible research project
based on the Waf framework.

It is derived from https://github.com/hmgaudecker/econ-project-templates and
the authors of this project deserve all the credit for the implementation of
Waf as a framework for reproducible research. My contribution is to add several
helpers around the project which are common in software engineering and should
help researchers to write better code, therefore more comprehensible and
reproducible research.
