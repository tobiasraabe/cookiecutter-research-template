Documentation
=============

The problem with guides on how to write documentations are more or less cheat
sheets for restructured-text which is not what I was looking for. Therefore,
here is an non-complete lists of what I consider to be helpful.

List of example projects
------------------------

- `Click`_ is a very cool command-line interface written in Python. The
  documentation is convincing and presenting the capabilities of the project
  very well. Use the `raw files`_  also as a formative style guide.

  .. _Click: https://click.palletsprojects.com/en/7.x/
  .. _raw files: https://github.com/pallets/click/tree/master/docs


List of Tips
------------

- The level of headings in this documentation does not have to be very deep.
  Therefore, only underline headings in the following order are used: ``=``,
  ``-``, ``^`` and ``~``.
