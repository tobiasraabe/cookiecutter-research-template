Documentation
=============

The problem with guides on how to write documentations are more or less cheat sheets for
restructured-text which is not what I was looking for. Therefore, here are some projects
which what I consider as beautiful and informative documentations.

List of example projects
------------------------

- `Click`_ is a very cool command-line interface written in Python. The documentation is
  convincing and presenting the capabilities of the project very well. Use the `raw
  files`_  also as a formative style guide.

  .. _Click: https://click.palletsprojects.com/en/7.x/
  .. _raw files: https://github.com/pallets/click/tree/master/docs


List of Tips
------------

- The level of headings in this documentation does not have to be very deep. Therefore,
  only underline headings in the following order are used: ``=``, ``-``, ``^`` and
  ``~``.
