Travis-CI
=========

Travis-CI is a service which allows you to test and deploy your projects. We are only
interested in the first aspect, testing, as Travis-CI allows us to run a complete
battery of tests every time a new commit is made on the master branch or every time a
pull-request is updated. This ensures that we are gradually improving the project and do
not introduce bugs or style issues in areas where we already have tests.

Broadly speaking, there are two categories of tests we are implementing in a research
project. The first category is about testing our data to ensure that the source files
are the same, intermediate results did not change, etc.. Most of the time, researchers
are bounded by confidentiality agreements to keep their data private. In this case you
cannot use Travis-CI to test your data and you need to skip this part of the testing
battery.

The second category of tests concerns the code which does not normally fall under the
former constraint and can be given into the hands of private company.


Installation
------------

To enable testing, go to https://travis-ci.com and choose log in with Github in the
upper right corner. Then, you have to agree that Travis-CI is allowed to have access to
your repositories. There is nothing to do afterwards as Travis-CI will automatically
check your repositories for a ``.travis.yml`` which includes all the build information.

To get an impression of a configuration file, take the following example of the
Travis-CI configuration of this template.

.. literalinclude:: ../{{cookiecutter.project_slug}}/.travis.yml

- ``notifications`` lets you define whether you want to be notified if a tests fails for
  some commit. My personal opinion is to disable notifications as they will flood your
  email inbox. You can also send notifications to Slack or other services.
- ``language`` defines the main language of your project. Depending on this choice,
  there are several other tools pre-installed.
- ``python`` sets the Python version of your test environment. The default is 3.6, but
  you are free to change it. Furthermore, you can test your project against multiple
  python versions by using:

  .. code-block:: yaml

      python:
        - 3.5
        - 3.6

  Note that for each Python version a different build is created meaning the same tests
  would run in a Python 3.5 and 3.6 environment in parallel.

The next three steps define the `build lifecycle <https://docs.travis-ci.com/
user/customizing-the-build/>`_. There are several ways to differentiate between
different stages of the build process. Here is one.

- In ``before_install`` we download pandoc to be able to use the latex builder for our
  documentation.
- In ``install`` we make sure that tox is installed and has the latest version to run
  our tests.
- In ``script`` we actually run the tests. As mentioned before, if you only want to run
  a subset of tests defined in tox, change the config to

  .. code-block:: yaml

      install:
        - tox -e flake8
        - tox -e black

  or something similar. Maybe you want to exclude ``pytest`` as some tests depend on
  data. In this case, I would recommend that you still include ``pytest`` and `mark
  tests which cannot succeed for different reasons
  <https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/skipping.html>`_.
- ``branches`` includes a current fix so that commits on PRs are not built twice.

There are a lot of things you can do. See this `document <https://docs.travis-
ci.com/user/customizing-the-build/>`_ if you are looking for a different configuration.
